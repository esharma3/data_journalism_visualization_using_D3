#### Why make a static graphic when D3 lets you interact with your data?
The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) and includes the data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
The additional labels on the scatter plot have click events that lets the user decide which data to display. The transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes is animated.
